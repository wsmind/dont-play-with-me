RELEASE NOTES FOR "don't play with me!"
=======================================

Thanks for playing "The Game!" ;)

This is built using the Löve framework.
https://love2d.org/

There are two versions released here.
Pick yours depending on your platform.

- the x86 version uses Löve 0.8.0 and may take up to a minute to load 
  (the screen may freeze during this time)
  
- the x64 version uses Löve 0.8.1 (experimental build) and loads up
  very fast.
  

If you play this game sometime in the future when Löve2D has shipped
a newer version, this still should work.
Feel free to follow installation instructions on https://love2d.org/


--- Game content ---
The game content (assets, sources...) is present in the src/ folder.
All game content has been produced with love (and Löve ;)) on location in Karlsruhe, Germany,
by a lovely team of 3 German designers and 2 French programmers.
